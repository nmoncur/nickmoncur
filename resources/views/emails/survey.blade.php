 <p>Hey <?php echo $user->name ?>,</p>

 <p>Thank you very much for reaching out to me on my website!</p>

 <p>I've received your inquiry and I'll be sure to reach out personally within a day or two.</p>

 <p>If you're up for it, I would love to get the process started. I like to have all of my clients fill out a 'needs analysis'. It's a quick survey that can help us both get an idea of what you'll need for your website. Here is a link to it:</p>

 <p>Don't hesitate to reach out via email, call, or text if you have any questions, otherwise, I'll plan on reaching out to you soon.</p>
